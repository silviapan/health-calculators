# Reach Healthy Weight Goal

I created a site to simplify the process of weight loss (and weight gain). 
The first step is understanding healthy weight ranges according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Next step is adjusting caloric intake to reach a weight within the healthy body mass index (BMI) range.

<ul>
<li>BMI calculator with suggestions on healthy weight range</li>
<li>Daily caloric intake calculator to determine needs based on BMI and activity level</li>
<li>Create chart to list out the new recommended intake with each kilogram lost (or gained)</li>
<li>Prediction on time needed to reach goal weight based on desired rate of change (Average, Moderate, Fast)</li>
<li>Footnotes to explain calculation process and list sources for further reading</li>
</ul>

The site is intended for any person who wishes to lose or gain weight in a steady, sustainable manner. In my future updates I plan to add a line graph to visualize the weight changes and goal dates.
