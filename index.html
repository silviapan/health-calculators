	<h2>1) Am I at a healthy weight?</h2>
	<p>Body mass index (BMI) is a value that represents the relationship between your height and weight. While it cannot predict with absolute certainty the ideal weight and health of the individual, it can be a great indicator of body fat percentage and the associated health risks. For example, a high BMI is strongly correlated with a high level of excess body fat. Please note that the calculator is intended for adult (ages 20+) use only. For a child and teen BMI calculator, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/">click here</a>.</p>

	<h2>2) How much should I eat?</h2>
	<p>All food contains calories, which are units of energy that your body needs to function. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum amount of energy used by the body at rest. The total daily energry expenditure (TDEE) takes into account activity level and multiplies the BMR by the according activity level. One important theory to keep in mind is "Calories In, Calories Out". When calorie intake is greater than calorie expenditure, weight gain occurs. Conversely, when calorie intake is less than calorie expenditure, weight loss occurs.</p>

				Note: If you are deciding between different activity levels, opt for the lower activity level because it is easy to overestimate caloric needs. Choose "Sedentary" if you are unsure which level to pick.
