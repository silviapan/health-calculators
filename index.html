				Experts condense weight management into one principle: <strong>Eat less to lose weight and eat more to gain weight.</strong>
				However anyone who has tried to lose or gain weight knows it may sound simple, but difficult to do.
				<br>Your first question might be, "But then how much is enough?"
				<br>The calculators can be used as a guide for both weight loss and weight gain. Get personalized results and recommendations. Take the guesswork out of how much to eat each day.

				<h3>Body Mass Index</h3>
				<p>
					Body mass index (BMI) is a value that represents the relationship between your height and weight. According to your height and weight, you can be classified as either underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

				<h3>Dive deeper into BMI</h3>
				<p>Body mass index (BMI) represents the relationship between your height and weight. While it cannot predict with absolute certainty the ideal weight and health of the individual, it can be a great indicator of body fat
					percentage and the associated health risks. <br>For example, a high BMI is strongly correlated with a high level of excess body fat.</p><br>
				<div class="formula">
					BMI = Weight/(Height x Height)
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>The formula uses metric units; weight is in kilograms (kg) and height is in meters (m). It returns a ratio of weight to height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). That ratio is then plotted on the chart to see which percentile it falls in. Below is
					the chart that classifies the BMI into weight categories.<sup>1</sup></p>

					<h3>Basal Metabolic Rate</h3>
					<p>All food contains calories, which are units of energy that your body utilizes to function. The basal metabolic rate <strong>(BMR)</strong> is the <strong>minimum</strong> amount of energy used by the body at rest, i.e. this is the amount of
						energy used only to keep your organs functioning. It varies according to your age, weight, height, sex, and body fat percentage.</p><br>

					<h3>Total Daily Energy Expenditure</h3>
					<p>The total daily energry expenditure <strong>(TDEE)</strong> is the <strong>total</strong> amount of energy needed in a day. It takes the BMR and multiplies it with a multiplier that reflects your daily activity level. Your TDEE is how much
						you would eat to maintain your current weight. One important theory to keep in mind is <strong>"Calories In, Calories Out"</strong>. When calorie intake is greater than calorie expenditure, weight gain occurs. Conversely, when calorie intake
						is
						less than calorie expenditure, weight loss occurs.</p>
					<p>The most widely used formulas to calculate caloric needs are the Harris-Benedict (HB), Mifflin-St Jeor (MSJ), and Katch-McArdle Equations (KA). For this calculator, MSJ is used because it is the most reliable for estimating the resting
						metabolic rate (RMR).<sup>1</sup> RMR differs slightly from BMR. Measuring BMR is more restrictive because it requires a 12-hour fasting and inactive period whereas RMR does not and it takes into account the amount of energy required to digest
						food.<sup>2</sup> For ease of explaining the caloric needs, the title displays "BMR" instead of "RMR." If no body fat percentage is inputted, the MSJ formula is used -- otherwise, the KA formula is used. The units are as follows: weight (kg),
						height (cm), age (years), and body fat (percentage).

						<br>BMR = 370 + 21.6 x {[Weight x (100 - Body Fat)]/100}
					</div>

					<br>
					<p>After getting the BMR, it is multiplied by a multiplier that corresponds to the activity level to get the TDEE.<sup>3</sup></p>
					<br>
					<div class="formula">
						<strong>TDEE</strong>
						<br>TDEE = BMR x Activity Factor

					</table>
					<br>For the levels with a range as a multiplier instead of one number, the lowest number of the range was used as the multiplier. If the calculated BMI were 2000 Calories and the activity level were 'Sedentary', the TDEE would equal 2000 x 1.2,
					totaling 2400 Calories. The TDEE represents an estimate of the total calories needed per day to maintain the body's current weight. Eating above the TDEE will result in weight gain and eating below would result in weight loss.

				<p>Based on the personal information you inputted, you received your BMR and TDEE. Eating at your TDEE each day will allow you to maintain your weight. In order to lose weight you would need to eat less than your TDEE. Conversely, if you aim to
					gain weight, you would eat more than your TDEE.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="formula">
					Calorie Deficit = TDEE x Rate
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>The rate change options are: Average, Moderate, and Fast. The percent change is 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. If your TDEE is 2000 and you are aiming to lose weight at a 'Fast' pace, you would need to have a 25% deficit in your daily
					calorie intake. Therefore, your deficit is 2000 x .25, or 500 Calories.</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are 3500 Calories in one pound of fat.<sup>1</sup>Therefore, in order to lose one pound of fat in one week you would need to eat 3500 fewer calories, about 500 fewer calories each day. However, for some people, a 500-Calorie deficit
					would be too large. The calculated deficit is used to calculate how many days to lose one pound. For example, if your deficit is 350 Calories, it would take you ten days to lose one pound.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For this calculator, the lowest value for the new recommended intake is your BMR. Another safety measure added is the lowest calorie limit: The lowest recommended calorie intake for women is 1200 Calories and for men is 1800 Calories.<sup>2</sup>It
					may be tempting to have a huge deficit to for quicker weight loss, but it would most likley be difficult to maintain a very huge deficit for a long period of time. The predictions are meant to take into account the decreasing TDEE with each
					pound lose and adjust the deficit so you can achieve your goal in a safe, steady manner.</p>

			<h2>How can I reach my goal?</h2>
			<h3>Calories In, Calories Out</h3>
			<p>Whether you aim to lose or gain weight, one simple principle applies -- <strong>Calories In, Calories Out (CICO)</strong>. If you want to lose weight, calorie intake should be less than calorie expenditure and vice versa is true to gain
				weight.
				TDEE is the amount needed to maintain your weight and eating less or more than that amount would result in weight change.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<h3>Tools to Help You Reach Your Goal</h3>
				<li>
					<h3>Calorie Counter</h3>
					<p>There are many wonderful calorie counting apps that you can download onto your phone to track the total amount eaten each day. With huge databases that everything from include fresh fruits to packaged snacks, these apps make calorie counting
						a cinch. Some popular calorie counter apps are MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and FatSecret. If you do you not have a smart phone or prefer not to use an app, consider keeping a food journal in which you write down the type of food and its portion
						size for each meal.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Food Scale</h3>
					<p>It can be very difficult to tell if you are eating the correct portion size. However, with a food scale you can measure out the portions for each meal and get even more accurate calculations for your calorie counter.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Exercise</h3>
					<p>You may notice that exercise was not mentioned as a requirement for weight loss because exercise is not neccessary to lose weight. You can reach your goal without ever having to exercise. However, exercising will help you burn calories and
						in
						turn help you shed the weight faster. Plus, it is also great for your health.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Sticking to your recommended calorie intake may be hard and some days you will mess up and that is fine. Whether you are aiming to lose weight or gain weight, make your new habits part of your lifestyle. If you find that you are still
				struggling and the scale does not seem to be moving, go back to step one and redo the calculations. Weigh your food and count your calories. <strong>There are no cheat days. Each day counts. Stay consistent and you will reach your goal!</strong>
